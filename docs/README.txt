The 'docs' directory is not a Java package but a crucial part of the project structure for storing documentation, 
including Javadoc HTML files. This directory is intended for developer reference and contains comprehensive documentation 
of the application's classes, methods, and overall architecture. 
The 'docs' enhance the maintainability and understandability of the codebase.
