The view package contains the graphical user interface (GUI) components of the application. 
These components define the structure, layout, and appearance of the application's user interface, providing an interactive environment 
for users to interact with the application's functionalities. The views are designed to present data to the user and capture user inputs, 
which are then processed by the controller classes.
